# Code of Conduct

KubeNova is an open source project, and we want it to be a welcoming, safe,
and productive place for everyone who uses, contributes to, or discusses it.

Everyone participating in this project is expected to:

- Be respectful and inclusive in both language and actions.
- Assume good intent, and disagree constructively.
- Keep discussions focused on technical topics and project goals.
- Avoid harassment, discrimination, and personal attacks of any kind.
- Respect different time zones, experience levels, and backgrounds.

Unacceptable behavior includes (but is not limited to):

- Harassment, bullying, or threats.
- Discriminatory language or imagery (related to gender, race, religion,
  disability, sexual orientation, etc.).
- Sustained disruption of discussions, issues, or code reviews.
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission.

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

- Prefer private channels for escalation (for example, GitHub’s reporting tools
  or direct contact with project maintainers).
- Include as much context as you can (links, screenshots, timestamps) so that
  maintainers can understand and address the situation.

Project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including
editing or removing comments, rejecting changes, or restricting accounts, when
behavior violates this Code of Conduct.

This Code of Conduct is inspired by the Contributor Covenant and other
community codes of conduct widely used in open source projects.
