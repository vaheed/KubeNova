## 0.1.1 – Cleaned baseline

- Repository hygiene: removed generated artifacts, standardized docs to VitePress, added kind helper script, and clarified single-source env handling.
- Documentation: new quickstart, API lifecycle walkthrough, operations (observability, upgrades, kind E2E), refreshed README, and roadmap.
- Version alignment: bumped charts/OpenAPI/manager version to 0.1.1 and introduced live integration test scaffolding against a running manager + kind cluster.
